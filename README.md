Introduction
This project aims to predict future energy consumption based on historical data using machine learning techniques. We utilize LSTM and RNN models, which are well-suited for time series prediction tasks due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-consumption-prediction.git
cd energy-consumption-prediction
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocess the data:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py
Train the models:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py --model lstm
python src/model_training.py --model rnn
Make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python src/prediction.py --model lstm
python src/prediction.py --model rnn
Dataset
The dataset used for this project should be placed in the data/raw/ directory. The data should be a CSV file containing historical energy consumption records.

Model Training
The models are defined in the models/ directory. The training scripts can be found in src/model_training.py. You can specify which model to train (LSTM or RNN) by passing the --model argument.

Results
Model evaluation results and plots are saved in the results/ directory. This includes performance metrics and visualizations of the predictions compared to the actual energy consumption.
